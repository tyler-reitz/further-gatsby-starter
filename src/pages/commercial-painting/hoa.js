      We understand the importance of getting the right color. In fact, it’s one
      of the most common issues we deal with when it comes to painting houses
      for Home Owners Associations in Los Angeles. No one wants that one house
      on the corner sticking out and looking like an eyesore, and getting the
      right color plays a vital role in getting an integrated look for the
      community. and we have experience in working with homeowners and HOAs to
      work within a color palette to the satisfaction of all concerned.

      Trifecta knows that the first step of any great-looking paint job is to
      make sure the paint specifications are perfect. By deciding in advance on
      the paint product line, specific primers, and the optimum gloss level for
      the topcoat, production on the job site can roll along without delays,
      changes, or interruptions. Professional painters know it’s never a matter
      of grabbing whatever materials they can find off the shelf, and that’s why
      we always put a lot of planning and careful thought into the exact
      specifications that will ensure your paint job will stand the test of
      time.
