    <h1 className="mb-2">Attract more customers.</h1>
    <p className="mb-4">
      No one wants to shop in a run-down, ugly building. They draw the
      conclusion that the products must not be worth buying because the building
      obviously isn’t worth maintaining. If they’re desperate, they may enter in
      spite of cracked, dirty walls and peeling paint—but if you’ve noticed a
      steady decline in customers, it could be that they don’t even want to step
      inside the store because of how it looks. On the other hand, a
      well-maintained building tends to attract shoppers. Painting your store is
      the kind of investment that can immediately boost your bottom line.

      out.

    <h1 className="mb-2">We paint tilt-ups, inside and out, year round.</h1>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Painting tilt-ups in Los Angeles often requires an understanding of paint
      chemistry to ensure proper bonding of primers and paints to a tilt-up’s
      concrete walls. Here at Trifecta Painting, one of our owners is an
      experienced paint chemist who keeps our crews educated on everything from
      pH levels to proper pressure washing to cleanse away concrete release
      agents in preparation for painting. It’s all done in order to ensure a
      high-quality finish that will last, year after year, season after season.
